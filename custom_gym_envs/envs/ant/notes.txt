What is a state/observation in Ant-v2?

In ant.py _get_obs() method:

self.sim.data.qpos are the positions, with the first 7 element the 3D position (x,y,z) and
orientation (quaternion x,y,z,w) of the torso, and the remaining 8 positions are the joint angles.

The [2:], operation removes the first 2 elements from the position, which is the X and Y position of
the agent's torso.

7 + 8 - 2 = 13

self.sim.data.qvel are the velocities, with the first 6 elements the 3D velocity (x,y,z) and 3D
angular velocity (x,y,z) and the remaining 8 are the joint velocities.

6 + 8 = 14

The cfrc_ext are the external forces (force x,y,z and torque x,y,z) applied to each of the links
at the center of mass. For the Ant, this is 14*6: the ground link, the torso link, and 12 links
for all legs (3 links for each leg).

14 * 6 = 84

Total = 13 + 14 + 84 = 111

The order of links in ant.xml and their corresponding state/observation entries are:

torso

front_left_leg
    hip_1: position obs[5], velocity obs[19]
    ankle_1: position obs[6], velocity obs[20]

front_right_leg
    hip_2: position obs[7], velocity obs[21]
    ankle_2: position obs[8], velocity obs[22]

back_leg
    hip_3: position obs[9], velocity obs[23]
    ankle_3: position obs[10], velocity obs[24]

right_back_leg
    hip_4: position obs[11], velocity obs[25]
    ankle_4: position obs[12], velocity obs[26]
