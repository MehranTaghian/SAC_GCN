1) The model architecture has changed for both Q-network and policy network. The global features for the state space includes the achieved goal.
2) The feature for nodes and edges have also changed according to the original observations of the environment
   which contain the qpos and qvel of the joint (TODO: double check).
3) The utils state_2_graph and state_2_graphbatch also changed to reflect the global features
4) The model architecture for Q-function changed and a linear layer added to estimate the state-action value.
