TODO are as follows:
1) change the action space to apply actions on each joint, instead of the gripper.
2) We should modify the graph. There are also static links between bodies that are not joints. Such as there should
be an edge between robot0:gripper_link and the main body.
3) Remove redundant edges. The second for-loop adds redundant edges (welded despite having a joint)
4) Think about an algorithm to remove redundant parts like cameras from the graph.
