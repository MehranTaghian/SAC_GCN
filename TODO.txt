TODO are as follows:
2) Think about an algorithm to remove redundant parts like cameras from the graph.
3) Perhaps deciding a feature vector for welded joints can be helpful
4) What is a mocap? in the mocap_set_action function, we set the action to move the end-effector to a specific position.
But we only have one mocap. Let's see how to define mocaps for moving joints. The mocap is for positioning the end-effector
as used in the fetch_env _env_setup function. It is also used in the mocap_set_action function in the utils. Instead of
that, you could consider using joints' qpos for moving the end-effector.

5) Create batch of graphs in the replay_memory sample function
6) change model structure of value and policy network to graph

7) for action value function, consider the state as the graph, and the action as the global features of the graph.
