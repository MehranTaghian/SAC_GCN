TODO are as follows:

1) Design the state of the environment based on the previous observation (the original fetch reach)

2) add achieved goal and desired goal as global features. Therefore, we should change the model of Q-function
and remove action from global features.

3) we should double check the observation space and action space to see if they are correct.

This one all is the same except we removed cameras and laser from the original robot (redundant parts)

screen: 94920.pts-2.mehran
This experiments we removed the last layer with 128 size outputs + the ones in the previous screen

#### None of the above worked properly
