TODO are as follows:

1) Design the state of the environment based on the previous observation (the original fetch reach)

2) add achieved goal and desired goal as global features. Therefore, we should change the model of Q-function
and remove action from global features.

3) we should double check the observation space and action space to see if they are correct.

4) attach everything to the world body

5) there is a mismatch between qpos and qvel and the graph qpos and qvel in ant env.

6) Model changed and achieved goal removed
