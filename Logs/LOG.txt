1) For fetchreach, we zero out the 3 key joints to observe the behavior of the robot and change in the LRP scores.
The list of weld joints exist in the fetch_env.py __init__() function.

2) action space changed to use joint velocities

3) Occlude all the mandatory joints: This was interesting because it was trying to move the other non-occluded joints
to reach the goal.

4) Simulate experiments in which when an action is applied to move a joint in some specific direction, move that
joint to the other side so to move against decision-making. This fault was applied on Elbow-flex-joint and observed
that all the joint's relevance scores became negative.

5) HalfCheetahGraphEnv-v0 max-episode-steps changed to 200

6) load edge_relevance object into notebook and analyze heatmaps

7) Since the sum of relevance scores would be equal, one should not consider summing or averaging the abs value of
relevance scores.
