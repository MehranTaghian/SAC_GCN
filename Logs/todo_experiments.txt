1) Rerun experiments for normal and faulty environments
2) For the normal environment, after learning, break those joints having zero score (based on our previous observation,
we do not have a negative score on joints) and see whether the policy is
transferable or not.

3) For the faulty environment, as we observed, there are some joints having negative score. Try to:
    i) Change their feature space to show zero all the time
    ii) or break those joints so that they would not have any negative impact on the learning process.

also experiments for fetchreachgraph with new graph model are running on melco and mehran

halfcheetah with new graph model is running on melco1 and mehran

experiments for original graph model for halfcheetah is running on melco2

Ant experiment running on melco1

walker2d experiments running on melco1
