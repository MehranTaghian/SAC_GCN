1) Rerun experiments for normal and faulty environments
2) For the normal environment, after learning, break those joints having zero score (based on our previous observation,
we do not have a negative score on joints) and see whether the policy is
transferable or not.

3) For the faulty environment, as we observed, there are some joints having negative score. Try to:
    i) Change their feature space to show zero all the time
    ii) or break those joints so that they would not have any negative impact on the learning process.

4) Experiments for walker are running on melco. The most important joint according to the heatmap was leg_left_joint
and the least important one was foot_left_joint. Another important joint was thigh_left_joint, which we haven't run
its experiment,yet. Consider running it after finishing current experiments.

5) those halfcheetahgraph experiments seed 3,6,9 that failed on melco2 are running on mehran
