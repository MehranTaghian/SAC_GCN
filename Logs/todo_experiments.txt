1) Rerun experiments for normal and faulty environments
2) For the normal environment, after learning, break those joints having zero score (based on our previous observation,
we do not have a negative score on joints) and see whether the policy is
transferable or not.

3) For the faulty environment, as we observed, there are some joints having negative score. Try to:
    i) Change their feature space to show zero all the time
    ii) or break those joints so that they would not have any negative impact on the learning process.
