1) Rerun experiments for normal and faulty environments
2) For the normal environment, after learning, break those joints having zero score (based on our previous observation,
we do not have a negative score on joints) and see whether the policy is
transferable or not.

3) For the faulty environment, as we observed, there are some joints having negative score. Try to:
    i) Change their feature space to show zero all the time
    ii) or break those joints so that they would not have any negative impact on the learning process.


run experiments for both occlussion and non-occlusion case for the basic controller. non-occludeds are already added.
occluded ones are running on melco

run experiments for fetchreach and halfcheetah on melco:
half cheetah: 1233141.pts-0.melco
fetchreach: 1233262.pts-0.melco
